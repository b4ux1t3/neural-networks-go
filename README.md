# Neural Network Research

This is a collection of my research into neural networks. Each file represents a concept that I have worked on. 

Much of this is based on Daniel Shiffman's videos on his YouTube Channel [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) and the book [Make Your Own Neural Network](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29746976-make-your-own-neural-network) by Tariq Rashid.
